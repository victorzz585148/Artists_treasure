AK_INTRODUCE,"Van Gogh presented himself in this self-portrait as a painter, holding a palette and paintbrushes behind his easel. He showed that he was a modern artist by using a new painting style, with bright, almost unblended colours. The palette contains the complementary colour pairs red/green, yellow/purple and blue/orange ¡V precisely the colours Van Gogh used for this painting. He laid these pairs down side by side to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and the orange-red of his beard.","Caf? Terrace at Night?is an 1888 oil painting by the Dutch artist?Vincent van Gogh. It is also known as?The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled?Coffeehouse, in the evening?(Caf?, le soir).",,,,,,,,
